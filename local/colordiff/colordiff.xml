<refsect1 id='description'><title>Description</title>

<para>&colordiff; is a wrapper for &diff; and produces the same output as
&diff; but with coloured syntax highlighting at the command line to improve
readability. The output is similar to how a &diff;-generated patch might appear
in <application>Vim</application> or <application>Emacs</application> with the
appropriate syntax highlighting options enabled. The colour schemes can be
read from a central configuration file or from a local user
<filename>~/.colordiffrc</filename> file.</para>

<para>&colordiff; makes use of ANSI colours and as such will only work when
ANSI colours can be used - typical examples are xterms and Eterms, as well as
console sessions.</para>

<para>&colordiff; has been tested on various flavours of Linux and under
OpenBSD, but should be broadly portable to other systems.</para>

<refsect1 id="usage"><title>Usage</title>

<para>Use &colordiff; wherever you would normally use &diff;, or pipe output
to &colordiff;:</para>

<para>For example:

<screen>
$ colordiff file1 file2
$ diff -u file1 file2 | colordiff
</screen>

</para>

<para>You can pipe the output to 'less', using the '-R' option (some systems or
terminal types may get better results using '-r' instead), which keeps
the colour escape sequences, otherwise displayed incorrectly or discarded by
'less':

<screen>
$ diff -u file1 file2 | colordiff | less -R
</screen>

</para>

<para>If you have <command>wdiff</command> installed, colordiff will correctly
colourise the added and removed text, provided that the '-n' option is given to
<command>wdiff</command>:

<screen>
$ wdiff -n file1 file2 | colordiff
</screen>

</para>

<para>You may find it useful to make &diff; automatically call
<command>colordiff</command>. Add the following line to
<filename>~/.bashrc</filename> (or equivalent):

<screen>
alias diff=colordiff
</screen>

</para>

<para>Any options passed to &colordiff; are passed through to &diff; except for
the colordiff-specific option 'difftype', e.g.</para>

<screen>
colordiff --difftype=debdiff file1 file2
</screen>

<para>Valid values for 'difftype' are: diff, diffc, diffu, diffy, wdiff, debdiff;
these correspond to plain diffs, context diffs, unified diffs, side-by-side
diffs, wdiff output and debdiff output respectively.  Use these overrides when
colordiff is not able to determine the diff-type automatically.</para>

<para>Alternatively, a construct such as 'cvs diff SOMETHING | colordiff' can be
included in <filename>~/.bashrc</filename> as follows:

<screen>
function cvsdiff () { cvs diff $@ | colordiff; }
</screen>

</para>

<para>Or, combining the idea above using 'less':

<screen>
function cvsdiff () { cvs diff $@ | colordiff |less -R; }
</screen>

</para>

<para>Note that the function name, cvsdiff, can be customized.</para>
