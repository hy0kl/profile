<para>&cdiff; is a wrapper for colordiff and will add colour to a diff given
in a URL or a file, e.g.</para>

<screen>
cdiff http://some.url.com/foo/thing.patch
</screen>

<para>It also adds support for reading gzip, bzip2 and lzma compressed diffs,
and like colordiff, also supports reading diffs from standard input if URL
or a filename is not specified.  &cdiff; pipes colordiff's output through
less -R.</para>
