PREREQUISITES

To use colordiff, you need Perl and an ANSI-colour enabled terminal.  To
install as per the instructions below, you also need GNU Make.

INSTALLATION (Debian)

All branches of Debian now include the colordiff package, so the easiest
way to install is simply by doing:

  apt-get install colordiff

You should then setup your colour preferences (see below).

INSTALLATION (Other systems)

1. (Optional) Edit the Makefile to change the preferred installation
locations - default is /usr/local/bin for the script itself, and /etc
for the central colour configuration file.

2. As root, type 'make install'.  If 'make' is unavailable, simply copy
colordiff.pl to /usr/local/bin and colordiffrc to /etc by hand.

3. The central colour configuration file, by default /etc/colordiffrc is
read by each instance of the script.  User-specific settings can be
enabled by copying this file to ~/.colordiffrc and making the
appropriate changes.

Note that by default, colordiff is configured to work in an environment
where the default background is generally 'dark'.  If you are using a
light-coloured background, the default colours in colordiffrc won't work
very well - in that case, manually copy the file colordiffrc-lightbg to
either /etc/colordiffrc or ~/.colordiffrc as appropriate.
