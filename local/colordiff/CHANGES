Changes between version 1.0 and 1.0.1

Addition of support for 'context' diffs and fixed 'colour over-run'
problem when shell prompt has no colours defined, thanks to Matthew
Gatto <mg2300@albany.edu>

Changes between version 1.0.1 and 1.0.2

The entire input stream is received before being examined for the type
of diff information it contains, the stream is no longer coloured 'on
the fly'.  This step improves identification of some types of diffs,
where seeing the whole output is required to determine the type of diff
being used.

Diffs generated by 'subversion' are now recognised, in addition to plain
diffs and CVS diffs.  Thanks to Graham Wilson <bob@decoy.wox.org> for
helping to troubleshoot the subversion diffs.

The colour 'black' can now also be specified in ~/.colordiffrc for use
by those with light-coloured backgrounds.  Thanks to Steven W Orr
<steveo@syslang.net> for helping to troubleshoot light-coloured
backgrounds.

Changes between version 1.0.2 and 1.0.3

More tolerance of whitespace in config file.

More elegant handling of directories other than '/etc' being the
location for the central colordiffrc and preserving a backup of an
existing /etc/colordiffrc at installation - thanks to Bernhard Bablok
<mail@bablokb.de>

Extra documenation for 'less' options provided by Niklas Vainio
<nvainio@iki.fi>

Changes between version 1.0.3 and 1.0.4

Added support for 'dark' colours, courtesy of patch from Michael Piefel.  Also
added support for long, command-line options to change colours on the fly,
courtesy of patch from Nathan Tenney <eulernt@yahoo.com>

Bug fix for inconsistent handling of arguments in the input stream - fix
received with thanks from Michal Maruska <mmc@maruska.dyndns.org>

Changes between version 1.0.4 and 1.0.5

Improved efficiency for diff-type detection and addition of a new colour
area, called 'cvsstuff' which allows an additional colour definition for
this type of output.  All these changes courtesy of a patch from Cory
Tusar <ctusar@adelphia.net>.  Other minor code 'tidying'.  Also included
code tidying from Kevin Ballard <kevin@sb.org>

Removed 'long colordiff colour options', originally contributed by
Nathan Tenney, since it appears to conflict with the use of additional
diff command-line options.  A proper fix is needed, but this change was
made to fix a bug at the expense of a probably little used (?)
functionality?  This change also fixes the bug which means that
colordiff returns the 'diff' return value correctly.

Inclusion of separate 'cdiff' shell script for colouring compressed and
URL-based diffs, following contribution from Ville Skyttä
<ville.skytta@iki.fi>

Changes between version 1.0.5 and 1.0.6

Finally(!) introduced support for 'side-by-side' diffs, including some
contributed code by Andrew Chadwick <andrewc@piffle.org>.  Also added
support for colour specifier 'off' (or 'normal' or 'none') to the config
file following feature request and patch from Wouter Bolsterlee
<uws@xs4all.nl>, to allow colour highlighting to be switched off for
some elements.

Now by default, when colordiff is redirecting output to a file, the
colours are switched off.  This relates to bugs raised by Adam Borowski
and Wang Jian.  For users wishing to retain this behaviour, the new
option "color_patches" has been introduced, which defaults to 'no'.

Some changes have been made to the default colours used, to help
visibility on as many different coloured terminals by default.

Changes between version 1.0.6 and 1.0.7

Support introduced for 'wdiff' colourising (thanks to Tom Regner); also
correctly handles undefined HOME (patches from various people).

Support for p4 diffs added by Alexis Layton, plus bug fix for blank 
first lines.

Changes between version 1.0.7 and 1.0.8

Support for numeric colours added, for 256-colour terminals (thanks to Gautam
Iyer).  Diff-types can now be specified explicitly, for use when diff-type
detection doesn't work or isn't possible.  Return diff's exit code, patch from
Tim Connors.  Allow extraneous diff text to be coloured separately.

Changes between version 1.0.8 and 1.0.9

Fix for http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=513313 incorporated
