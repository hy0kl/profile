Bugs and limitations

There is always the possibility of colour selections (either the defaults
or those chosen by a user) will result in output where the text 'disappears',
because the foreground and background colours are the same.  There is no way
to detect terminal colours and so this is always a danger.  See
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=368973 - The standard
workaround is to choose either colordiffrc or colordiffrc-lightbg, as
appropriate for the colour scheme in use.

Colourising of 'wdiff' output requires that the '-n' option is given, i.e.
'wdiff -n', which avoids spanning the end of line while showing deleted or
inserted text.  See 'man wdiff'
